## Introduction

The Chemistry SL study guide is developed by the students from 2020'

We may update HL contents if we've got extra time (and efforts)

Because of our scarce learning resources in the classes (u know), I decided to pack up some practice Qs before mid-term.

As time is limited for ver 1.0, the contents mainly came from IB Chemistry Syllabus and QuestionBank Ver3 and 4.
